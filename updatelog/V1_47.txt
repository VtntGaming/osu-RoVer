Time has come, osu!RoVer Stable V1.47 is LIVE!
Here's the upcomming change to the next version...


-> Gameplay
  - Since the game is likely to get an input lag, I will apply some change to the input register:
      + Your input will be half of the frame earlier. For example, if you are running on 60fps your input will be 8.3ms earlier.


-> Beatmap files:
  - Fixed "some of the map" huge audio delay
-> Beatmap listing
  - Search now support deep searching with different stats
      + Support index: >, <, >=, =, <=
      + HP sort: hp, hpdrainrate, healthdrainrate, health
      + CS sort: cs, circlesize, size
      + OD sort: od, overalldifficulty, acc,  accuracy
      + AR sort: ar, approachrate
      + Difficulty sort: dr, difficultyrating, diff, sr, starrating, star, stars
      + Support all type of caps, example: this, THIS, This, ThIs, tHiS, ect...
  - Fixed bug where you cannot search with a specific special characters
  - You can now Shift + Delete to clear the search box
  - The song auto will switch to the relevant map you search (unless the current song is in the search result)
  - Improved UI
