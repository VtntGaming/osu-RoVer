!THIS UPDATE LOG IS NOT FINAL, CHANGES CAN BE MADE IN THE FUTURE!

Time has come, osu!RoVer Stable V1.47 is LIVE!
Here's the upcomming change to the next version...

-> Difficulty/ Perfomance Score
  - Change to Flashlight mod:
    + FL mod calculation now worked individually, used it's own calculation to determine the flashlight diff and flashlight PS
    (Before change: FL mod directly effect aimPS based on the length of the map)
    + Flashlight Diff now can be avaiable in Live difficulty display
    + Flashlight Diff will have the power of 0.8 on TD
  - Change to TouchDevice mod:
    + Removed multiplier of 0.6 on Aim and FL perfomance, instead we apply a power of 0.8 on the Aim and FL difficulty, this can significantly decrease the Perfomance Score
  - Change to AccuracyPS: Removed base multiplier on SpeedAdjust (SA) mod on AccPS (Before change: AccMultiplier = AccMultiplier * Speed | Due to Timing value update)
  
-> Gameplay
  - Sliders update:
    + Update slider tick mechanism, it's now specified which timing will be appear
    + Updated slider drawing calculation for those large slider point maps (god-ish, der wald, ...)
    + New slider shadow draw, can be enabled on the settings (WIP/can decrease perfomance on low-mid end devices)
  - ScoreV2 update:
    + Players now can view other player's ScoreV2 score
    + ScoreV2 now seperate Consistency and Accuracy score into 2 different part, Consistency have the maximum score of 700000 and Accuracy have the maximum score of 300000
    + Spinner score will directly add into ScoreV2 with a multiplier of 0.1
    + Multipliers can directly effect on ScoreV2
    + New multiplier: Miss penalty -> Decrease score when miss (more forgiving on high note count map, minimum multiplier is 0.75)
  - ScoreV1 update:
    + Adjusted accuracy score so when FC + SS Accuracy score is approximately equal to (TotalScore - SpinnerScore) * 0.3
    + Accuracy and score value will not effect the Consistency Score
    + New multiplier: Miss penalty -> Decrease score when miss (more forgiving on high note count map, minimum multiplier is 0.75)
  - Timing value now can be changed by the SpeedAdjust mod
    + Based on the changed Hit300 timing value after speed, the OD rate will be changed, which will effect the difficulty and PS more likely.
  - Since the game is likely to get an input lag, I will apply some change to the input register:
      + Your input will be half of the frame earlier. For example, if you are running on 60fps the game will register input as 8.3ms earlier.
  - Change to hit windows in overall:
    + Before:
      > hit300 = 119.5 - 9 * OverallDifficulty     |  TDhit300 = 159.5 - 12 * OverallDifficulty
      > hit100 = 219.5 - 12 * OverallDifficulty    |  TDhit100 = 279.5 - 16 * OverallDifficulty
      > hit50  = 299.5 - 15 * OverallDifficulty    |  TDhit50  = 399.5 - 20 * OverallDifficulty
      > EarlyMiss = 400                            |  TDEarlyMiss = 500

    + After: 
      > hit300 = (100 - 8 * OverallDifficulty) / SongSpeed        |  TDhit300 = (150 - 12 * OverallDifficulty) / SongSpeed
      > hit100 = (175 - 10 * OverallDifficulty) / SongSpeed       |  TDhit100 = (220 - 12.5 * OverallDifficulty) / SongSpeed
      > hit50  = (250 - 12.5 * OverallDifficulty) / SongSpeed     |  TDhit50  = (275 - 13.5 * OverallDifficulty) / SongSpeed
      > EarlyMiss = 425 / SongSpeed    |  TDEarlyMiss = 440 / SongSpeed
