 -- V1.25 -- 

-- Debug
> Fixed bug that make user leaderboard with FL mod have Score: 0 (0x)
> Fixed frozen score submit
> Making the score of the result only have 0 digit [Ex: Old: 1.234 | New: 1]
> Some small in-game fix

-- Update
> Flashligh is buffed, making it a little bit harder than before
> Added a perfomance rework (this update is supposed to be release at prev update), making it harder to get.
> Added a option to display perfomance in real-time at top-left corner
> Added perfomance leaderboard, where you can see perfomance score from top #1,000 [Thx to Neex#3712 for giving me idea of this leaderboard design]
> [Beatmap submit] is now revamped into [osu!Beatmap browser], you can search for detailed info about it.
> Beatmap now can be stacked with hypes, more hype = more chance to get into game
