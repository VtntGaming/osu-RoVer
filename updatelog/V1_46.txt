! THIS IS NOT FINAL VERSION !
! VERSION ONLY AVAIABLE ON BETAPLACE !

- Difficulty/ Perfomance calculation:
  + Big change to Overall PS/ Difficulty calculation
    > CurrentStrain changed from: Adds up from base Aim and Speed difficulty
      to: Make as a combination of current AimStrain and SpeedStrain (both is separated, also adds up)
    > [BETAPLACE TESTING] Reworked calculation of both Aim and Speed
    > [STUDIO TESTING] Added new separated Aim and Speed difficulty. (Go to Console by pressing F9 to view map's Aim/Speed diff)
  + [BETAPLACE TESTING] Changes to Accuracy PS:
    > [BUFF] AccuracyPS changed 
        from MaxAccuracyPS * 0.82 ^ (100 - Accuracy) 
        to math.min(MaxAccuracyPS * 12.87 * 0.9 ^ (100 - Accuracy), MaxAccuracyPS * 0.98 ^ (100 - Accuracy))
    > AccuracyPS slowly drop from 100% to 54.55% at 70% accuracy and then will start drastically dropping to 7% at 50% accuracy and keep going
      Example map: Ashrount - AureoLe ~for Triumph~ [FINAL]

- Gameplay:
  + [BETAPLACE TESTING] Upcomming beta changes for osu!RoVer ScoreV1 calculation: 
    > Old score calculation:
      - Total score = base score
      - Base score adds up = Hit value * (1 + (Combo multiplier * Difficulty multiplier * Mod multiplier / 25))
    > New score calculation:
      - Total = base score + accuracy score
      - Base score adds up = Hit value * (1 + (Combo multiplier * Difficulty multiplier * Mod multiplier / 25 * 0.75))
      - Accuracy score = math.pow((300s + 100s + 50s)/300, 2.265) * Difficulty multiplier * Mod multiplier * 0.25 
    > Examples:
      - 100 300s | Old: 393,600 | New: 302,700 + 50,827 -> 353,527 (89.8%)
      - 1000 300s | Old: 36,336,000 | New: 27,327,000 + 9,356,023 -> 36,683,023 (100.9%)
      - 100 100s (33.33% acc) | Old: 131,200 | New: 100,900 + 4,221 -> 105,121 (80.1%)

    Variables:
    * Hit value: 0, 50, 100, 300
    * Combo multiplier: math.max(prevCombo - 1, 0)
    * Difficulty multiplier: 6

  + Changes to HP drain:
    > General changes: Buffed base HP drain, HP drain on high-stream, making the HP bar not draining so much effecting the gameplay.
    > Detailed changes: *below*
    > [BUFF] Base HP drain (HP below 5) increased from [1 - 1.75] to [3 - 5] [*1]
    > [BUFF] Base HP drain (HP 5 and above) increased from [1.75 - 3] to [5 - 10] [*1]
    > [NERF] HealthDrainMultiplier base decay rate increased from 28.33% to 30.00% of (HealthDrainMultiplier-1)/sec [*2]
    > [BUFF] HealthDrainMultiplier minimum decay rate decreased from 2.0 to 1.5/sec
    > [NERF] HealthDrainMultiplier gain rate decreased from [0.3/0.1] to [0.15/0.1] [*3]
    > [NERF] HealthDrainMultiplier max multiplier changed from UNLIMITED to 5
  + Changes to Approach algorithm:
    > Movement changed from TweenSerice tween to RunService.RenderStepped constant update (applied to HD, not applied 100% to SL yet)
  + Time jump on Replays and AT mod:
    > Click on the timeline to instantly move into the selected time (backward avaiable, PS and accuracy bug may occur)
    > Feature CANNOT be used for other purpose (play will be instantly unranked if you do)
  + Others:
    > Better song transision.
`   > Minor changes to the interface.
    > Added difficulty strike indicator on the Live difficulty display.



[*1] Unit: % drain of HP per sec on HP [1 - 5] or [5 - 10]
[*2] Unit: % drain of HealthDrainMultiplier per sec
[*3] Unit: HealthDrainMultiplier gain everytime a [Note/SL note] passed

> Variable explain:
  - Base HP drain: Calculated %HP drain per second without any Multiplier
  - HealthDrainMultiplier: Multiplier for Base HP drain
