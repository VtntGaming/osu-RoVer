osu!RoVer Stable V1.45 has been RELEASHED
Let's check it out what's new!

- Difficulty/PS Calculation: (literally took me a week non-stop to remake this o.o)
  + Nerfed Low CS maps (and EZ)
  + New strain system, the strain goes up when the notes is stacking difficulty. When it goes up to it's max, it's the difficulty!
  + The game no longer calculate which note is the hardest to determind the difficulty, instead it will calculate which part have the most strain!
  + (Yes, alot of 9-11 stars map were drop down to 5-8 stars)
  + We will start recounting every player in the game (not possible), starting from top 1.

- Settings:
  + Added new settings: Instafade Circle, Hitkey Overlay, Live Difficulty Display, Display hit300 (All are asynced)
  + Aynced settings for Circle number scale and Circle number overlaps (This is a bugfix as it's suppose to asynced before)
  + Added skin settings: Cursor Trail Fadetime [0 - 2] (Seconds)
  + Cursor Trail Size and Cursor Size changed it's limit from [0.1 - 2] to [0 - 10] (You can just make it invisible if you want)
  + Numbher scale changed its limit from [0.1 - 2] to [0 - 2] (Make it invisible if you want)
  
- Gameplay:
  + Optimized perfomance no longer insta-fade circles, instead you will have to enable Instafade Circle for it.
  + Make the game to show the Health drain speed on the health bar on Optimized Perfomance
  + Score and PS no longer animate in Optimized perfomance, it's now fully insta-change
  + Made the spinner more sensitive with low framerate devices. (Normally if you spin more than 72 degrees in 1 frame it will count as 18 degrees)
  + As a calculation for spins more than 90 degree per frame: New degree record = math.max(180 - degrees change in this frame,3.6)
  + Some more animations and fixes to the spinner.
